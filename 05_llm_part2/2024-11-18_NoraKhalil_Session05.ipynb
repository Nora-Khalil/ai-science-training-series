It was easier to see what the thought process of the model when using the COT processes, however, this method did not lead to a result that was any more accurate than the zero- and few-shot methods. I think, if not asking about a mathematical question, the model answer would increase in quality when using the COT methods. Unfortunately, it just seems like the model could not handle the identification of odd numbers, and always offered the wrong response since it could never get this first identification step correct.
